Deep investigation of the CycleGAN model [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) : construction, training configurations, used metrics etc. Also studying the impact of the "anchor loss" (we added one matched pair of images and its loss to the unpaired datasets) on the model performance and the ability of the CycleGAN to do a transfer learning.
* GAN for Image-to-Image translation 
* Python, Pytorch, Google Cloud Platform
