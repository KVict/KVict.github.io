Knowing that the models of the epidemic spread could be described by systems of nonlinear ODEs whose coefficients characterize the features of population and disease.I worked on the construction and investigation of numerical algorithms for determining these coefficients by the global minimization of the multidimensional target function.
* Investigated methods : Genetic algorithms, Simulated annealing algorithm, Tensor Train method etc.
* Implementation of tools for solving the direct and inverse problems for systems of ODEs.
* Python, C++
